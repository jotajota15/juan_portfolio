# Introduction

My name is Juan José Valverde Campos, this is my portfolio of all of the projects I've worked on. The most of them were created while I was a student at the Universidad de Costa Rica, but I also created several for myself.

I have decided to showcase this portfolio using an interest-based index so that you can easily access all of my projects for the specific interest that you desire.


# Index 




I beg your pardon if you see the most of them are written with spanish comments
