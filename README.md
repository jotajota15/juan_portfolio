# Introduction

My name is Juan José Valverde Campos, this is my portfolio of all of the projects I've worked on. The most of them were created while I was a student at the Universidad de Costa Rica, but I also created several for myself.

I have decided to showcase this portfolio using an interest-based index so that you can easily access all of my projects for the specific interest that you desire.


# Index 

1. [Machine Learning Projects](#machine-learning-projects)

2. [NOSQL and Data Projects](#nosql-and-data-projects)

3. [Cloud Projects](#cloud-projects)

4. [Data Manipulation Projects](#data-manipulation-projects)

5. [Math and Statistic Projects](#math-and-statistic-projects)

6. [Other IT Projects](#other-it-projects)
